# CRIME-TRENDS-ANALYSIS-IN-WEST-AFRICA-1970-2020-
An analysis of crime trends in West Africa over 50 years (1970–2020). 

Introduction
As part of my academic journey in data analytics at Vephla University, I conducted an analysis of crime trends in West Africa over 50 years (1970–2020). This study utilized a dataset from Kaggle, encompassing crime records from six countries: Ghana, Nigeria, Cameroon, Benin, Chad, and Niger. The goal was to identify trends in crime incidents, weapons usage, affected groups, and perpetrator activities, providing actionable recommendations to reduce and control crime rates in the region.
This analysis highlights the urgency of a collaborative, multi-stakeholder approach to reduce crime in West Africa. By leveraging data-driven insights and implementing these recommendations, the region can make significant strides toward a safer and more secure future.

Conclusion
Nigeria stands at the forefront of crime statistics in West Africa, with the highest records of injuries, fatalities, and crime incidents over the 50-year period analyzed. This position underscores the critical need for immediate, targeted interventions to address the underlying causes and mitigate future occurrences.
